## 🌏 Introduction
AISBench Benchmark is a model evaluation tool built based on [OpenCompass](https://github.com/open-compass/opencompass). It is compatible with OpenCompass’s configuration system, dataset structure, and model backend implementation, and on this basis, extends support for service-deployed models.

Currently, AISBench supports evaluation scenarios for two major types of inference tasks:

🔍 [Accuracy Evaluation](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/scenes_intro/home.html#id2): Supports accuracy verification of service-deployed models and local models on various question-answering and reasoning benchmark datasets.

🚀 [Performance Evaluation](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/scenes_intro/home.html#id5): Supports latency and throughput evaluation of service-deployed models, as well as extreme performance testing under stress test scenarios.


## 🛠️ Tool Installation
✅ Environment Requirements

**Python Version**: Only Python **3.10** or **3.11** is supported.

Python 3.9 and below are not supported, nor are versions 3.12 and above.

**It is recommended to use Conda for environment management** to avoid dependency conflicts:
```shell
conda create --name ais_bench python=3.10 -y
conda activate ais_bench
```

📦 Installation Method (Source Code Installation)

AISBench currently only provides source code installation. Ensure the installation environment has internet access:
```shell
git clone https://gitee.com/aisbench/benchmark.git
cd benchmark/
pip3 install -e ./ --use-pep517
```
This command will automatically install core dependencies.
Execute `ais_bench -h`. If the help information for all command-line options of the AISBench evaluation tool is printed, the installation is successful.

⚙️ Service Deployment Framework Support (Optional)

If you need to evaluate service-deployed models (such as vLLM, Triton, etc.), install additional dependencies:
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/api.txt
pip3 install -r requirements/extra.txt
```

🔗 Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Evaluation Support
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/bfcl_dependencies.txt --no-deps
```

**Important Note**: Since `bfcl_eval` automatically installs the `pathlib` library (which is already built into Python 3.5+ environments), use the `--no-deps` parameter to skip automatic installation of additional dependencies to avoid version conflicts.

For further configuration or to initiate evaluation tasks using CLI or Python scripts, refer to the [Quick Start Guide](#quick-start).


## ❌ Tool Uninstallation
To uninstall AISBench Benchmark, execute the following command:
```shell
pip3 uninstall ais_bench_benchmark
```


## 🚀 Quick Start
### Command Meaning
A single or multiple evaluation tasks executed by an AISBench command are defined by a combination of model tasks (single or multiple), dataset tasks (single or multiple), and result presentation tasks (single). Other command-line options of AISBench specify the scenario of the evaluation task (accuracy evaluation scenario, performance evaluation scenario, etc.). Take the following AISBench command as an example:
```shell
ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt --summarizer example
```
This command does not specify other command-line options, so it defaults to an accuracy evaluation task, where:
- `--models` specifies the model task: the `vllm_api_general_chat` model task.
- `--datasets` specifies the dataset task: the `demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt` dataset task.
- `--summarizer` specifies the result presentation task: the `example` result presentation task (if `--summarizer` is not specified, the `example` task is used by default for accuracy evaluation scenarios). It is generally used as default and does not need to be specified in the command line (subsequent commands will omit this option).


### Task Meaning Query (Optional)
Detailed information (introduction, usage constraints, etc.) about the selected model task (`vllm_api_general_chat`), dataset task (`demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt`), and result presentation task (`example`) can be queried from the following links:
- `--models`: 📚 [Service Deployment Inference Backend](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/models.html#id2)
- `--datasets`: 📚 [Open-Source Datasets](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/datasets.html#id3) → 📚 [Detailed Introduction](ais_bench/benchmark/configs/datasets/demo/README_en.md)
- `--summarizer`: 📚 [Result Summary Tasks](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/summarizer.html)


### Preparations Before Running the Command
- `--models`: To use the `vllm_api_general_chat` model task, prepare an inference service that supports the `v1/chat/completions` sub-service. Refer to 🔗 [Start an OpenAI-Compatible Server with VLLM](https://docs.vllm.com.cn/en/latest/getting_started/quickstart.html#openai-compatible-server) to launch the inference service.
- `--datasets`: To use the `demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt` dataset task, prepare the GSM8K dataset. Download it from 🔗 [GSM8K Dataset Compressed Package Provided by OpenCompass](http://opencompass.oss-cn-shanghai.aliyuncs.com/datasets/data/gsm8k.zip). Deploy the unzipped `gsm8k/` folder to the `ais_bench/datasets` folder under the root path of the AISBench evaluation tool.


### Modify Configuration Files for Corresponding Tasks
Each model task, dataset task, and result presentation task corresponds to a configuration file. These files need to be modified before running the command. The paths of these configuration files can be queried by adding `--search` to the original AISBench command. For example:
```shell
ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt --search
```
> ⚠️ **Note**: Executing the command with the `--search` option will print the absolute paths of the configuration files corresponding to the tasks.

Executing the query command will yield results similar to the following:
```shell
06/28 11:52:25 - AISBench - INFO - Searching configs...
╒══════════════╤═══════════════════════════════════════╤════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════╕

```

- The dataset task configuration file `demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt.py` in the quick start does not require additional modifications. For an introduction to the content of dataset task configuration files, refer to 📚 [Configure Open-Source Datasets](https://ais-bench-benchmark.readthedocs.io/en/latest/base_tutorials/all_params/datasets.html#id6).

The model configuration file `vllm_api_general_chat.py` contains configuration content related to model operation and needs to be modified according to actual conditions. Modifications required for the quick start are marked with comments:
```python
from ais_bench.benchmark.models import VLLMCustomAPIChat

models = [
    dict(
        attr="service",
        type=VLLMCustomAPIChat,
        abbr='vllm-api-general-chat',
        path="",                    # Specify the absolute path of the model serialized vocabulary file (configuration is generally not required for accuracy testing scenarios).
        model="DeepSeek-R1",        # Specify the name of the model loaded on the server, configured according to the actual model name pulled by the VLLM inference service (configure as an empty string to get it automatically)
        request_rate = 0,           # Request sending frequency: send 1 request to the server every 1/request_rate seconds; if less than 0.1, all requests are sent at once
        retry = 2,                  # Maximum number of retries per request
        host_ip = "localhost",      # Specify the IP of the inference service
        host_port = 8080,           # Specify the port of the inference service
        max_out_len = 512,          # Maximum number of tokens output by the inference service
        batch_size=1,               # Maximum concurrency for sending requests
        generation_kwargs = dict(   # Model inference parameters shall be configured with reference to the VLLM documentation. The AISBench evaluation tool does not process these parameters, which will be included in the sent request.
            temperature = 0.5,
            top_k = 10,
            top_p = 0.95,
            seed = None,
            repetition_penalty = 1.03,
        )
    )
]
```


### Execute the Command
After modifying the configuration files, run the command to start the service-based accuracy evaluation (⚠️ For the first execution, it is recommended to add `--debug` to print detailed logs to the screen, which makes it easier to troubleshoot errors that occur when requesting the inference service):
```bash
# Add --debug to the command line
ais_bench --models vllm_api_general_chat --datasets demo_gsm8k_gen_4_shot_cot_chat_prompt --debug
```


#### View Task Execution Details
After running the AISBench command, details of the task execution will be continuously saved to the default output path. This output path is indicated in the logs printed to the screen during execution. For example:
```shell
06/28 15:13:26 - AISBench - INFO - Current exp folder: outputs/default/20250628_151326
```

This log indicates that the task execution details are saved in `outputs/default/20250628_151326` (under the directory where the command was executed).
After the command completes, the task execution details in `outputs/default/20250628_151326` are structured as follows:

```shell
20250628_151326/
├── configs # Combined configuration file for model tasks, dataset tasks, and result presentation tasks
│   └── 20250628_151326_29317.py
├── logs # Execution logs; if --debug is added to the command, no intermediate logs are saved to disk (all are printed directly to the screen)
│   ├── eval
│   │   └── vllm-api-general-chat
│   │       └── demo_gsm8k.out # Logs of the accuracy evaluation process based on inference results in the predictions/ folder
│   └── infer
│       └── vllm-api-general-chat
│           └── demo_gsm8k.out # Logs of the inference process
├── predictions
│   └── vllm-api-general-chat
│       └── demo_gsm8k.json # Inference results (all outputs returned by the inference service)
├── results
│   └── vllm-api-general-chat
│       └── demo_gsm8k.json # Raw scores calculated from the accuracy evaluation
└── summary
    ├── summary_20250628_151326.csv # Final accuracy scores (in table format)
    ├── summary_20250628_151326.md # Final accuracy scores (in Markdown format)
    └── summary_20250628_151326.txt # Final accuracy scores (in text format)
```
> ⚠️ **Note**: The content of saved task execution details varies across different evaluation scenarios. For specifics, please refer to the guide for the respective evaluation scenario.


#### Output Results
Since there are only 8 data entries, results will be generated quickly. An example of the output is shown below:
```bash
dataset                 version  metric   mode  vllm_api_general_chat
----------------------- -------- -------- ----- ----------------------
demo_gsm8k              401e4c   accuracy gen                   62.50
