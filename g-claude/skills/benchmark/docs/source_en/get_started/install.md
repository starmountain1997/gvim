# Tool Installation & Uninstallation
## 🔧 Tool Installation
✅ Environment Requirements

**Python Version**: Only Python **3.10** or **3.11** is supported.

Python 3.9 and lower versions are not supported, nor are Python 3.12 and higher versions compatible.

**It is recommended to use Conda for environment management** to avoid dependency conflicts.
```shell
conda create --name ais_bench python=3.10 -y
conda activate ais_bench
```

📦 Installation Method (Source Code Installation)

Currently, AISBench only provides the source code installation method. Ensure the installation environment has internet access:
```shell
git clone https://gitee.com/aisbench/benchmark.git
cd benchmark/
pip3 install -e ./ --use-pep517
```
This command will automatically install core dependencies.
Execute `ais_bench -h`. If all command-line help information for the AISBench evaluation tool is printed, the installation is successful.

⚙️ Service-Oriented Framework Support (Optional)

If you need to evaluate service-oriented models (such as vLLM, Triton, etc.), you need to install additional relevant dependencies:
```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/api.txt
pip3 install -r requirements/extra.txt
```
🔗 Berkeley Function Calling Leaderboard (BFCL) Evaluation Support

```shell
pip3 install -r requirements/bfcl_dependencies.txt --no-deps
```

**Important Note**: Since `bfcl_eval` will automatically install the `pathlib` library, and the Python 3.5+ environment already has this library built-in, be sure to use the `--no-deps` parameter to skip the automatic installation of additional dependencies and avoid version conflicts.

## ❌ Tool Uninstallation
If you need to uninstall AISBench Benchmark, you can execute the following command:
```shell
pip3 uninstall ais_bench_benchmark
```
